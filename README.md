```libpopcnt.h``` is a header-only C/C++ library for counting the
number of 1 bits (bit population count) in an array as quickly as
possible using specialized CPU instructions i.e.
[POPCNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#POPCNT_and_LZCNT),
[AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions),
[AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions),
[NEON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#Advanced_SIMD_(Neon)),
[SVE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64#Scalable_Vector_Extension_(SVE)).
```libpopcnt.h``` has been tested successfully using the GCC,
Clang and MSVC compilers.

## C/C++ API

```C
#include "libpopcnt.h"

/*
 * Count the number of 1 bits in the data array
 * @data: An array
 * @size: Size of data in bytes
 */
uint64_t popcnt(const void* data, uint64_t size);
```

## How to compile

```libpopcnt.h``` does not require any special compiler flags like ```-mavx2```!
To get the best performance we only recommend to compile with
optimizations enabled e.g. ```-O3``` or ```-O2```.

```bash
cc  -O3 program.c
c++ -O3 program.cpp
```

## CPU architectures

```libpopcnt.h``` has hardware accelerated popcount algorithms for
the following CPU architectures:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>x86</b></td>
    <td><code>POPCNT</code>, <code>AVX2</code>, <code>AVX512</code></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>x86-64</b></td>
    <td><code>POPCNT</code>, <code>AVX2</code>, <code>AVX512</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>ARM</b></td>
    <td><code>NEON</code>, <code>SVE</code></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>PPC64</b></td>
    <td><code>POPCNTD</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

For other CPU architectures a fast integer popcount algorithm is used.

## How it works

On x86 CPUs, ```libpopcnt.h``` first queries your CPU's supported
instruction sets using the ```CPUID``` instruction (this is done only once).
Then ```libpopcnt.h``` chooses the fastest bit population count algorithm
supported by your CPU:

* If the CPU supports ```AVX512``` the ```AVX512 VPOPCNT``` algorithm is used.
* Else if the CPU supports ```AVX2``` the ```AVX2 Harley Seal``` algorithm is used.
* Else if the CPU supports ```POPCNT``` the ```POPCNT``` algorithm is used.
* For CPUs without ```POPCNT``` instruction a portable integer algorithm is used.

Note that ```libpopcnt.h``` works on all CPUs (x86, ARM, PPC, WebAssembly, ...).
It is portable by default and hardware acceleration is only enabled if the CPU
supports it. ```libpopcnt.h``` it is also thread-safe.

We take performance seriously, if you compile using e.g. ```-march=native```
on an x86 CPU with AVX512 support then all runtime ```CPUID``` checks are removed!

## ARM SVE (Scalable Vector Extension)

ARM SVE is a new vector instruction set for ARM CPUs that was first released in
2020. ARM SVE supports a variable vector length from 128 to 2048 bits. Hence
ARM SVE algorithms can be much faster than ARM NEON algorithms which are limited
to 128 bits vector length.

libpopcnt new ARM SVE popcount algorithm is up to 3x faster than its ARM NEON
popcount algorithm. Unfortunately runtime dispatching to ARM SVE is not yet well
supported by the GCC and Clang compilers and libc's. Therefore, by default only
the (portable) ARM NEON popcount algorithm is enabled when using libpopcnt on
ARM CPUs.

To enable libpopcnt's ARM SVE popcount algorithm you need to compile your program
using your compiler's ARM SVE option e.g.:

```bash
gcc -O3 -march=armv8-a+sve program.c
g++ -O3 -march=armv8-a+sve program.cpp
```

## Development

```bash
cmake .
make -j
make test
```

The above commands also build the ```benchmark``` program which is
useful for benchmarking ```libpopcnt.h```. Below is a
usage example run on an AMD EPYC 9R14 CPU from 2023:

```bash
# Usage: ./benchmark [array bytes] [iters]
./benchmark
Iters: 10000000
Array size: 16.00 KB
Algorithm: AVX512
Status: 100%
Seconds: 1.23
133.5 GB/s
```
